Description: 
    Hulu ad-hoc reports for liveramp subscribers. These reports are non-sequential  due to the fact that 
    the liveramp Hulu subscriber psid list doesn't contain any timestamps so we don't know exactly when they subscribed.
    As a result of this, we just look for overlap between the subscriber list and samsung universe ("matches" or "matched users") 
    and provide a lift report on app usage and time spent for "matches".

Client:         Hulu
Parent Report:  N/A
Created by:     Vaughn Haynes

Methodologies:
Measurement KPIS = App Opens, Time Spent
Measurement Period = Campaign duration
Attribution Window = N/A
Last/Any Touch = N/A
Time Sequential = No
Minimum App Usage Duration = 1 min s
Lift Analysis = Exposed vs Unexposed, Frequency, Placement, Creative, Flight, Daily
Lookback Window = N/A 

Markets: US

      data_ad_xdevice, profile_tv, data_tv_smarthub, adbiz_data

 Template: Hulu - LiveRamp & App Pixel Attribution Report
 Wiki: https://adgear.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAST/pages/19409273050/Hulu+-+LiveRamp+App+Pixel+Attribution+Report

 Ticket:
    https://adgear.atlassian.net/browse/SAI-6738


 Instructions:
 -- Follow setup steps 1 and 2 below.
 - Update vao_list variable to include 1 or more vaos from the JIRA ticket (e.g. '126354, 938726')
 - Update the stage file path in temp table "liveramp_subscribers_s3" with the path from the ticket (e.g., 
        CONVERT: s3://samsung-dm-data-share-analytics/export/20240508/psid/321480.csv
        TO: @udw_prod.udw_clientsolutions_cs.samsung_dm_data_share_analytics/export/20240508/psid/321480.csv
    ) OR use the "COPY FILES" logic below to move it to a custom directory since the default file location is deleted after a few days
 - Run the report (approx 70 mins)
 - Get template: https://github.com/SamsungAdsAnalytics/QueryBase/blob/master/UDW/MnE/Content_Partner/Hulu/US_UDW/New_Attribution_Report_Template/
    Filename: 20240513_hulu_liveramp.xlsx
 - There will be multiple tabs from the query output. Start with tab 6 and copy the data to the Excel template (1 tab per table)
 - Be sure to update the Name and Flight Period metadata at the top of the excel file. This info is META tabs 4-5.
 - Be sure to update the VAO column on each tab from "combined" to use the correct VAO if only 1 VAO is used. Info on tab 4. 
 - When pasting data, if you see the error "This wont work because it would move cells in a table...", select the table below the one
    you are pasting to and drag it down to make room. Try re-pasting. If the tab;e you are adding to will expand and olverlap the table below it
    then you get that error so just make room by dragging it down.
- Rename the file "0000_Hulu_Attribution.xlsx" where 0000 is the Jira Ticket number

STEP 1. FIND AND REPLACE VALUES
---------------------------------
Find and eplace: 

    6738            --> Jira ticket number (https://adgear.atlassian.net/browse/SAI-6738)
    20241007        --> timestamp from liveramp subscriber file's destination path (from ticket) (s3://samsung-dm-data-share-analytics/export/20241007/psid/321480.csv)
    321480.csv      --> file name from liveramp subscriber file's destination path (from ticket)
    187896          --> vao number from ticket (VAO-187896)

---------------------------------
STEP 2. COPY FILES
---------------------------------
Run script below:
